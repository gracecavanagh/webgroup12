  <h1>ArcGIS Dashboards</h1>
  <p>An ArcGIS Dashboards are a way of presenting location information and relative data on the same screen, so that everything you need to make a decision or monitor conditions are right in front of you at once. Optionally, you can use data from Esri Living Atlas like the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) along with items from your content on ArcGIS Online. Configurable elements include maps, gauges, indicators, charts, lists, and tables that you can use to enrich the interactive experience and display your data.</p>

    <!-- Explanation of the process -->
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>Please note: these links may be unusable in the future due to licensing expirations.</p>
    
      <p>Step 1. I selected data from ArcGIS Online to use in a Scene.</p>
    
      <img src="images/portlanddata.png" alt="Portland Item Page" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" class="w3-center"><img src="images/copopendata.png" alt="COP REST Page" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
   
      <p>Step 2. I added the layers into ArcGIS Online Scene Viewer, enabled the legend so it would transfer to the options on the Dashboard configuration page, <a href="https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/home/webscene/viewer.html?webscene=d88d88ca30e5403b8caea20e969503a6">and published it here</a></p>
  
      <img src="images/portlandscene.png" alt="Portland Scene Viewer" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;>
   
      <p>Step 3. Under "New App" in my Content, I selected "Dashboards" and began working with the different configurations available.</p>
    
      <img src="images/dashboardsettings.png" alt="Portland Dashboard Settings" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;>
  
      <p>Step 4. In "Mobile" view, I selected "Body" to browse through and add an Esri Living Atlas layer: NOAA USA Wind Speeds. That didn't work (more about why below), so I went in and changed it to NOAA USA Storm Reports which still didn't end up working. Nonetheless, I configured it to group the types of storms so you can filter by "Snow" for example, and if I managed to make it work it would show you where in the past week it has snowed. Users can select that filter by clicking the filter button and the bottom of the screen.</p>
  
      <img src="images/dashboarddrawer22.jpg" alt="Portland Dashboards" style="max-width: 100%;>
    
      <p>Step 5. In "Mobile" view, I selected "Drawer" to browse through and add one the matching live update data for NOAA USA Storm Reports. The window at the bottom will now show the most recent storm reports.</p>
   
      <img src="images/dashboarddrawer33.jpg" alt="Portland Dashboards" style="max-width: 100%;>
   
      <p>Step 6. I also added an ACS Poverty Status Boundaries layer in order to see differences at the city level. I made a similar filter option to only see the level for whatever counties are selected.</p>
 
      <img src="images/dashboarddrawer.jpg" alt="Portland Dashboards" style="max-width: 100%;>
   
      <p>Step 7. Once I made a "splash screen" that shows up when you first open the Dashboard, and made the same filter options in the "desktop" view, I published the Dashboard to ArcGIS Online.</p>
    
      <img src="images/dashboardsplash2.jpg" alt="Portland Dashboards" style="max-width: 100%;>
    <h2>What didn't work:</h2>
  
      <p>Neither NOAA layers worked. For the first one (wind) it was because I didn't realize it was "multiple point data" until I tried putting it in Scene Viewer which isn't supported. I still don't know about the storm layer.</p>
       <p>My phone crashed a few times, so it's very important to keep the amount of layers and configurations to a minimum for mobile use. </p>
    
      <img src="images/dashboarderror2.jpg" alt="Empty Dashboard">
   
      <p>The hardest part was finding compatible data. It took a while before I was able to find decent 3D data that was compatible with Scene Viewer. I didn't get to try out the gauge and other configurations because the data I could find didn't work with it.</p>
      <p>Overall, Dashboard is a great way to interact with a map on your mobile device that requires additional data to understand and use it effectively, but it is just Scene Viewer with add-ons that may cause your phone to crash if you're not careful with the amount of data there. So for maitenance workers in the field, this may be useful, but Scene Viewer works well on a mobile device alone if you need to manipulate a 3D map.</p>
 
     <h2>What worked:</h2>
   
      <p>ArcGIS Dashboard is a great mobile option for displaying 3D data, as long as you keep the layers and amount of data to a minimum. It is visually appealing and usually loads fast on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
