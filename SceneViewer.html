<h1>ArcGIS Scene Viewer</h1>  
<p>ArcGIS Scene Viewer is a web-based application that allows users to explore and interact with 3D geographic information directly in their web browsers. 
  Scene Viewer lets users visualize terrain, buildings, and other geographic features. 
  It provides tools for navigation, measurement, and analysis, empowering users to gain insights and make decisions based on their 3D data. 
  As part of the ArcGIS Online platform, Scene Viewer simplifies access and sharing of 3D content with others.</p>

  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>First, I logged in to my ArcGIS account and open Scene Viewer.</p>
  <p>Then, I started a new scene and picked a basemap that fits the best for my plan.</p>
  <p>Next, I added open street map 3d building and open street map 3d trees data layers from Esri living atlas to the map.</p>
  
  <p>After that, I adjusted the view to get the perfect angle and zoom level.</p>
  <p>Then I added slides to show different seasons, played with measurement tools.</p>

      <img class='w3-center' src="./images/ST_step2.png" alt="" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;">
    </div>
  
  
  <p>I also changed colors and symbols to make the map look nice, and even add pop-ups to show extra information when someone clicks on something.  </p>

<!--Explaination why the mapbox application is good or Bad-->
<h2>Process</h2>

  <p>First, I sign in to my Mapbox account and open the Mapbox Studio application.</p>
  <p>Then, I created a new project and select the 3D map style you want to use as a base.</p>
  <p>Next, I used the existing building layer in the mapbox studio. one can add their own data layer by uploading their data (MBTiles, KML, GPX, Geojson, Shapefile, CSV files).</p>
  <p>Then I customized the appearance of the layers by adjusting colors, symbols, and labels.</p>
  <p>After that, I changed the building polygon to 3D buildings by changing the building layers type from fill to the fill extrusion (an extrusion 3d polygon) under select data tab and under its style tab filled the height formula: height.</p>
  <p>Once I was happy with my 3D map, I published it.</p>
  <p>One can share it with others by embedding it on websites or integrating it into mobile apps.</p>


  <h2>What Didn't Work</h2>
<p>What didnt work in the mapbox was the fixed zooming extent. Where the 3D buildings layer were only visible after one extent.</p>
<p>I tried to see if I can represent the 3D terrain features in the map box. 
  I found that while I can adjust the terrain elevation by giving the height and styling it by data condition, 
  but still could not show the complex terrain features properly.</p>

  <p>Then, I created a new dashboard project and selected a layout that includes a 3D map component.</p>
  <p>Next, I added my 3D map layers by connecting to existing web maps.</p>
  <p>Later I customized the appearances of the map by adjusting symbology, labels, and basemaps to best represent my data.</p>
  <p>I also configured the map settings where I enabled the features like pop-up, legends, basemap switcher, search, find my location pan/rotate and zoom in/ out.</p>
  <p>Additionally, I incorporated interactive elements like filters and selectors to allow users to explore the 3D map dynamically.</p>
  <p>We can also modify the appearance od the header tab by adding logos.</p>
  <p>Finally, once my dashboard was complete. I published my dashboard and share it with others.</p>
